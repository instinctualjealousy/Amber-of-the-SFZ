# Pettinhouse DirectBass 2.0 SFZ
A custom, somewhat-blind reimplementation of DirectBass 2.0's entire sample script in SFZ format for use with SFZ 2.0 compatible players like Sforzando<br />
My understanding of SFZ format is recent<br />
Used Mildon's SFZ Designer to start before going over to hand-formatting it<br />
Referenced NTO's DirectBass Free SFZ for release mapping and sustain blending<br />
<br />
All keyswitches are available on all patches<br />
Made for my own personal usage
