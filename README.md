Made for my own personal usage, as I had pirated many things for "The Amber in Embers" album back in 2012.<br />
The album will be re-released soon, and I want it to be piracy-free this time around.<br />
Feel free to fork and improve these scripts if you like, as my knowledge of SFZ is minimal!
- I purchased DirectBass 2.0 a couple years ago with the intent of reworking this album with entirely legally obtained instruments and plugins
- I never purchased Kontakt, so I needed a way to load DirectBass 2.0 up- Music Production 2: Enter Sforzando
- Never purchased ezdrummer or Nashville EZX (which were heavily used on my old stuff) and needed to get that Black Beauty snare back
# Pettinhouse DirectBass 2.0 SFZ
A custom, somewhat-blind reimplementation of DirectBass 2.0's entire sample script in SFZ format for use with<br />
SFZ 2.0/ARIA compatible players like Sforzando. All keyswitches are available on all patches!<br />
Scripts are mapped to the default sample directory names DIrectBass 2.0 ships with.</br >
<br />
DirectBass 2.0 is available for purchase [here](https://www.pettinhouse.com/html/directbass.html), and well worth the $49 for its punchiness.<br />
Credit to  NTO for his DirectBass Free SFZ, it was a good point of reference.
# Drum Werks Ludwig Black Beauty Snare SFZs
Simple mappings of both the Muted and Open variants of DW's free Black Beauty snare sample packs.<br />
DW's "Open" samples in particular fit my needs almost perfectly.<br />
<br />
This is great for augmenting cheaper sample sets like MT Power Drumkit or Druminator with the sound, if you're willing to produce it a bit.<br />
Get these sounds [here](https://www.drumwerks.com/category/free-stuff/). Put the downloaded *.wav files into a folder called "Samples", with said folder alongside the SFZ script(s).
