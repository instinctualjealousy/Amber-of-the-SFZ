# Pettinhouse DirectBass 2.0 SFZ
A custom, somewhat-blind reimplementation of DirectBass 2.0's entire sample script in SFZ format for use with SFZ 2.0 compatible players like Sforzando
My understanding of SFZ format is recent
Used Mildon's SFZ Designer to start before going over to hand-formatting it
Referenced NTO's DirectBass Free SFZ for release mapping and sustain blending

All keyswitches are available on all patches
Made for my own personal usage
